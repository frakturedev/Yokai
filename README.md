# Yokai
Yokai keyboard, a split keyboard with 5*7 column staggered keys.  Like Corne/Sofle but bigger and worse.

Most recent significant changes - Increased pinky stagger and added an additional thumb key.

Hopefully it will look a little like this:![Yokai Layout](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90110204/132105698-7eccd56c-9329-4aa9-885b-debc463be86f.PNG)
